* The Market DAO Manifesto and White Paper

** Introduction and Goals, and a Note on Style

In what follows, I hope to damage a beautiful narrative.  The narrative in question is an epic of gods and soldiers, good an evil, and cosmic battles.  What I'm trying to supplant it with is boring story about resource constraints in the human brain and how they cause problems in our built environment.

I'll admit I have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, the model I'm presenting is much more useful for making decisions (IMO, obviously).  But on the other hand, I'm damaging something beautiful and inspiring.  It is my hope that any damage I do is minor and that these grand myths will continue to inspire great acts well into the future.  However, to compensate the reader for replacing such an exciting narrative for such a banal one, I offer two things:

- First, I offer some partial solutions based on my model, and I'm putting those solutions into the form of usable code.

- Second, I will eschew the standard academic writing style in favor of one which I hope will be more entertaining.  IOW, I'm told I'm quite funny, and I'll try to use that to make this whole thing a little less boring.


** Why humanity is broken

 I chose the title for this section carefully.  I will not argue here *that* humanity is broken.  That has been done exhaustively by much more eloquent prople than myself.  I'm also not going to try to make an exhaustive list of what's wrong (I am, after all, only one man, and have only one lifetime!).  What I am going to do here is boil all of the down to a single cause, and in so doing, introduce you to the man who passes for a villain in this story.

 To begin with, it bears pointing out that I tend to blame problems on their discoverers.  This is, of course, hardly fair, but has a long, storied tradition, and dammit, I'm sticking to it!  So, in my view, Heisenberg broke determinism, Turing broke Mathematics, and Robin Dunbar broke humanity.

To put it another way:  all of humanity's problems, going back to around the birth of agriculture, boil down to our exposure to the wrong number of people.

It's not any cosmic forces, it's not our "evil nature," it's not even the various game theory conunundra that Scott Alexander so brilliantly personifies as Moloch.  Why?

Well, there are no cosmic forces (sorry), our nature is by no means "evil", and all the game theory issues are easily addressed with proper coordination.  And evolution provided us with an excellent mechanism for coordination in the form of communication, kinship, and close relationships.

Sadly, that mechanism doesn't scale.  It only works if we retain large amounts of information about the people we interact with, and we can only store that much infomation about 150 people or so.  Past that, coordination starts to break down, and the various demonic personifications of game theory start to rear their hideous heads.

So what happened was, our coordination mechanisms were so successful that they led us to create an environment in which they no longer work.  

That's the problem in a nutshell.  All of it.  Really.

In communities of under 150, everybody knows everybody, and at least to some extent, everybody helps everybody out (yes, there are notable exceptions, but existence of such communities is strong evidence that, at the very least, they can exist).  No laws are needed, as norms suffice.  Even money is superflous as it's easy to keep track of debts.  Contracts are unnecessary as reputation is critical.  Harmony is by no means guaranteed, but at least it's *possible* without any intentional interference.  Coordination in such communities just comes naturally.

Beyond that number, it is no longer possible to know everyone you interact with.  You are now forced to deal with strangers, whose behavior you have no way of predicting, and additional, artificial mechanisms are necessary to make coordination possible.
